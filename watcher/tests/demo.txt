# Demo
# 
# Scenario: A user will enter "localhost:8000" URL in their browsers, and will create a LogWatch object with id = 0
#           Then user will construct a rule tree on LogWatch 0
#           Then two log senders will send their logs to the LogWatch Manager from port 5140
#           After sending process filtered logs will be seen on client browser and will be checked with sample_result.log
#           Then a client will perform two delMatch operations on LogWatch 0
#           Resulting tree will be seen checked accordingly.

## Run LogWatch Manager
## Run django development server from localhost:8000

User
    Create new Watcher
    Create new Watcher (<-- For testing if mechanism can create multiple Logwatch instances)
    Clicks Rules button of Logwatch 0

## Run two senders with two different log sources:
    ../log_sender.py samples/sample.log
    (Upon finish of first sending process)
    ../log_sender.py samples/sample2.log

# During sending process on any of the clients can see the filtered log count (and also the rule count) of each individual LogWatch instance

# After sending process, check filtered logs with "sample_result.log" on Logwatch 0 with clicking Logs button

User:
    Clicks Logs button of Logwatch 0

# After checking with "sample_result.log" user can delete any rules to see that "DelMatch" operation works

For example:
    DelMatch --> Path: (0,0)
    DelMatch --> Path: (1,1)
